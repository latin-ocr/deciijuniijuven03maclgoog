The former is supposed to be the subject, with his wife Myrtale, of
an epitaph of four lines on a ‘cippus’ preserved among the Arundel
marbim, with the heads of nn eldarly man and woman ¹. Both these
persons were Greeks, connected, aa is clear from the gentilician nemas
they bore, with Roman familias of distinction.

Paetus Thrasea is mentioned by Juvenal, with his son-in-law, Helvidius
Priscus (S. v. 36). His character was that of an honest man in times
of the worst corruption, and his affection for Persius, which the Gram-
marian says lasted nearly ten years, and therefore only ended with his
death (for Thrasea survived him four years), was a strong testimony to
the poet’s goodness. Itis said they sometimes travelled together, hut
we are not told where they travelled. There is uo traoe in the writings
of Persius of his having been ont of Italy. Thraseawas put te death with
scarcely the shadow of a pretext, ab. 66. The Senate condemned him
under compulsion.

Arria the wife of Thressa, was the daughter of Arria mentioned
above, and it was for her Persius wrote the lines on her mother's death
which were destroyed with his other juvenile productioris. The relation·
ship between Arria and Persius is not known.

His father, it appears, left a sister, and it would seem that she lived
with her sister-iu·law after Flaccus' death. According to the amended
text of the life Persius had an only sister. It does not appear whether
his mother had any family by her second marriage. His love for these
ladies aud his dutiful attention to them are represented as most exem-
plary, and to their society no doubt, as Jahn says, he owed much of that
maidenly modesty and gentleness of character which the Grammarian
attributes to him. That he was carefully watched and kept hom tempta·
tion in boyhood may be inferred from what hc says to Cornutus, S. v. 32,
sqq, and the same care was shown in the selection of thet good man
for his teacher. His father when he died left him under a ‘tuton’
whose name is not mentioned, but who there is every reason to sup·
pose discharged his trust faithfully, for Persius died rich, leaving
his mother and sister between them two milliens of sesterces¹ in ready “
money.

His death took place on the 24th November, i.1›.62, at his own
counhy house, eight miles from Rome, on the Appian road, which was
so lined with the villas of wealthy Romans that Bovillae, four miles
further ou, was sometimes called a suburb. (See note ou S. vi. 52.)
