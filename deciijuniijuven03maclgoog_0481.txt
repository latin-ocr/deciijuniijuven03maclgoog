SATIRA VI.

INTRODUGTION.

Ριιιιιιιιιι lest satire, like Juvenel'e, is ιι fragment. Thut he wrote slowly, ιι ιιι
Gremmurien seps, may be easily believed, end his eerly deeth moy heve overtaken him
before he hed time ιο ιιιιιιι ιιιι poem. This would give ιι ιιι interest which ιιι itseli'
it hus not.

The poet hes retired lor the winter ιο ιιι coest, end is living on ιιι ιιοιιι οι ιιι
(ιιιιι of Speziu (Lunae portus), where, if the Scholiast is ιο be believed, his mother
lived ulter her second marriage. He sits down towrite ιο his friend Caesius Bassus,
the lyris poet; end ulter peying ι high compliment ιο ιιι genius, he commende the
climate end sceuery end retirement of the place he is steying ιι. There he lives free
from ull anxiety aud all jeelousy οι ιιι neighbours' prosperity. He contrasts his cvm ,
stete of mind with that οι men, on the one hund, who deny themselves the necessarios
of life, und, on the other, who run through their estete in their youth with riotous
living. He expresses his resolution ιο eujoy what he ιιι got, end advises eli men ιο
deal liberelly vvith their meses, living up ιο ιιιιι· income, and being ready ιο help
ι friend in time ol need, even οι ιιι sacrifice οι part of their estete. This suggestion
brings up the principal subject of the satire, which ιι ιιι sully ol those who deny
themselves for the sake οι ιιιιι ιιιιι, ιι ιιιοιιιιιι subJ‘eet with Horace. Whether ιι
was the poet's intention to continuo thet subject to the end οι ιιι satire, or to put in
ιιι οιιιι point oi, view the spiritns money-getting, it is impossible ιο say. But
1 am surprised thet casaubon, Jahn, end others should treet tho satire ιι ιιι entire
composition. It is menifestly ιιιιιιιιιιιιιι, und so ιιι (ιιιιιιιιιιιιιιιί memoir ex-
pressly states.

Of Caesius Bessus not much is known. He ιιι ι lyrio poet, end Persius, with the
pertiality oie friend, speaks highly ol* ιιι poems. But Quintilian hed no grem opinion
