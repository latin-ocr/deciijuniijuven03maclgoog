assertion, aud in many cases Ι have preferred the readings of other
MSS, of which Ruperti has given acatalogue aud description. Ι
myself am in possession of one which is not in Ruperti’s list. Itis
neatly written on parchment in 8vo. form, but is incompleta and of
no particular value, being an Italian MS. of the early part perhaps
of the.fifteenth century. As it is not a transcript of any MS.
referred to by other editors, I have occasionally noticed it, and
have called it M. Many of its readings in disputcd passages Ι

and Hermann sely too much Ι think ou the MS. they do well to
prefer. Hermann keeps more closely to it than J ahn, sometimesI
think with good reason. They have not published commentaries.
'Phe notes to which I attach most value are those of Heinrich,
published by himself without the text ‘iu 1806, 1810, and repub-
lished by his son two years after his death (Bonn, 1839), witha
text corrected in wcoulanoc with his fatheffs commentary. 'lhese
notes did not satisfy the judgment of Madvig, who thought them
bsueath th01eputation and abilities of their author. To me they
appear throughout manly and scnsihh, free from pedautry (the
plagae of commentarios), and woffly of the great writer whom it
is their only object to explain. As there is no ancient author that
requires masculine sense to understand and explain his meaning so
much as Juvenal, so I know of no commentator on any author that
surpasses Heinrich in that quality. His notes am in German, and
I suppose this is the reason why Ruperti's edition continues tc be
much used by studente in this country. It is the work of an
industrious man of weak mind, always liablo to waver when his
judgment happens to be right, but never to be relied upon in cases
of difficulty. Nor is he strictly honest, for he changed his interpre-
tations in some instances in his later edition, without acknowledging
that he was indebted to Heinrich for his second thoughts. A
smart and rather sarcastic review of Ruperti's notes was put forth
by Heinecke (Halle, 1804), and is sometimes referred to in the
notes of this edition. Heinecke is often wrong himself. He was
young when he wrote. The Parisian editor, Achaintre (1810), has
