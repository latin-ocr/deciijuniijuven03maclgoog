Hadrian succeeded 'lhajan in an. 117, and there is an allusion te the .
silence 51 the 51551551 Ι)51551 15 vi. 555, which makes it appear that the
Satira was written before the reign 51 Hadrian, or et its commencement,
for he restored 5555 oracle which Nero had stopped. This probably
took place. during Hadrian's residcnoe at Athens, sm. 123-126.

It is not certain in what years 51 515 reign Hadrian erected the mag-
nificent palace near Tibur, 51 which 55515155 still exist ς probably not
before 111. 184. But it is certain it was not built when Juvenal wrote
his 1551555555 Satira, 51 55 would have referred to 15 among the build-
ings he names vv. 86-91.

But the seventh Satira, which has been 555 subject 51 55 much disputa,
appears to me to hear the strongest internal evidence 51 having been
written in Hadrian's reign. He was an author himself, and the patron
51 5555515, and Juvenal could not have said this 51 any 5155555551
emperors that preceded him without egregious flattery‚ 51 which he was
incapable. The statement 51 555 Scholiast that in 5555 satire “Nero·
nem palpat ” is 555 worthy 51 notice. ,

Τ55 51555555 Satira turns upon an event said to have happened
“nuper Consule J unio '’ (v. 27) ¹. It may not be possible to say with
certainty which consul Junius 55151515 to. But my own opinion, and
'that 51 many others, 15, that it was J unius Rusticus who was consul in
11). 119, the second year 51 Hadrian's reign. 1 cannot doubt that in
this Satire Juvenal refers te his own experience 51 Egypt during 51551-
dence there in former years. Heinrich’s pupil, Eranche, hae taken
great pains to show that Juvenal had never been in Egypt. But heis
obliged te get rid 51 55 many verses as spurious which 1 believe to be ae
genuine as any in the Satira, that his arguments are 51 55 valna 15 my
opinion. It is possible Juvenal may heve been in Egypt before an. 84,
when the only other Junius, Appius Junius Sabinus,- was consul, that
being the third year 51 Domitian’s reign. In that 5555 the whole story
51 515 exile by Domitian becomes 5 15515, 55 555 details 51 15 manifestly
515, unless it be said that the Satira was written 15 Egypt, or, 11 written
at Rome, that the 5555 had been recalled by the emperor who sent him
