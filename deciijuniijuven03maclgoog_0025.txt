Indapondently of the chronological difficulties in respect to Paris, it
does not appear ιιιοι the verses quoted by the Grammarians were ever
intended as a satire on him, but if any thing as a compliment. So at
least they appear in the connexion in which we have them. Auditis
perfectly clear that iu that connexion they could not have given offanae
to the emperor, whoever he was, since the satire sets out from the first
with such praise as the worst of these princes oovated and rewarded,
praise sor his exclusive support of learning. Is therefore it had been
possible to admit these verses aa the cause of Domitian’s displeasure, it
must have been when they appeared separataly as au epigram, or with a
different context from the present, which it must be admitted they do
not very well suit, if, aa seems certain, the rest oi the Satira was written
long aftarParis’ death. It is the way with the Roman Satiriets to repre-
sent living names and characters by dead, aud soma have supposed that
hy Paris is meant a favourite actor of a later reign. But though there
may have been later counterparts of Statius, it is not likely that there
was another Paris, or any one whom his name would represent, whether
with Hermann we refer the Satira to 'lkajan’s time, or, as 1 believe it
should be, ιο Hadriau’s.

As to the place of Juvenal's supposed exile, 1 do not think it neces·
eary to argue the subject against Francke ¹, who denies the fact and
decimes Juvenal never was in Egypt at all, or against Hermann ¹, who
holds that he was sent to Scotland. Ihave uo doubt hehad been in
Egypt before he wrote the fifteenth Satira. That he ever visited
Britain 1 think cannot be proved, and it is not very likely. It is enough
ιο say that Agricola fought the last battle in Caledonia (ou the Gram-
piaus) au. 84, in which year he was recalled, having completely sub-
dued the country. But we have seen that Juvenal was at Rome as late
as au. 94, after which there was no fighting against the Scoti, and ii it
was the emperor's desire that the poet should be killed, as the Gram-
marian says, be would not have been sent to join the troops in Britain
sor that purpose. The inscription quoted by Hermann, if genuine, and
il' it refers to our Juvenal, proves nothing in favour of a Caledonian
exile. [See the uoteon Sat. iil. 320. Ribbeck assumes that the inscrip-
tion there mentioued refers to the Satirist Juvenal, who according to this
inscription had served in the Roman armies, and as a commender ot' a
eohort of Delmatae or Dalmatae, and he adds ‘quoniam Dalmatarum
