xxxvi INTRODUCTION.

ιο bc interpolatione, and his judgmsnt on them may be viewed as a
challenge to all those who maintain that they are genuine. His repu-
tation as a critic will depend on his success or failure in establishing
his opinion. The fourth Satira, as it stands, has an introduction of
thirty-six verses, which have been added, as Ribbeck assumes, by
some uuskilful hand. He is not the first critic or reader who has felt
some surprise at finding a long Prologue to nothing, for the first thirty·
six lines baveno connexion with the real subJ‘ect of the Satira, though
there are critice who admira this Prologue and think itis appro-
priate and a fine piace of composition. The beginning of the Prologue
announces that Crispinus is again brought on the stage, and the writer
declares his intention to sammon him often to play his part. We
expect that we are going ιο read a terrible invective against the fellow3
but after a few general remarks about his villany, we are told that the
present Satira will only treet of his emaller offences, and then comes the
particular charge against him cf buying a fish at an enormous price,
and eating it himself. The 'mention of the fish is supposed hythe
admirere of tha Prologue to be a clover way of connecting the intro-
duction with the real Satira, the subject of which is the great fish that
was presented ιο Domitian. But what becomes of Crispinus after this
flourishi He plays a most insignificant part in the scena before the
Emperor, and says not a word about the hig lish, though something
would have been very much ιο the purpose from a man who was a
buyer of lish, and in his early days cricd them through the streete of
Rome. If Juvenal wrote this Prologus to the Satira, we cannot
commend his teste. Ribbeck goes into particulare, and examinas
various parts of this Prologue in order to confirm his general cou-
demnation of it.

The other long passage, which Ribbeck treats as an interpolation, is
the Introduction of fifty-five lines which is prefixed ιο the eleventh
Satira. This Introduction resemblas that to the fourth Satira in this
respect, that if you cut it off, you lose nothing of the real Satira, which
is an invitation to a friend to come and dine with Juvenal. This
friendly epistle is a charming composition, and reminds us, as Ribbeck
observes, of Horace’a humour and genial temper. lf Juvenal wrote the
Prologue, he 'would have done better if he had commenced his epistle
at once without a preface.

This Essay also contains a short chapter cn verses which have been
transposed in Juvenal’s text, and on the passages where something
appears to have been lost. The last chapter, written in Latin, is on
the famous sixth Satira, the disorderly arrangement of which the learned
critic has attempted to correct.

This ingenious Essay contains matter which a futrue editor of Juvenal
