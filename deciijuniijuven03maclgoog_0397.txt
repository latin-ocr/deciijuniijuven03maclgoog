SATIRA XV,

Saltatns nigro tibicine, qualiacunque

Unguenta et flores multaeque in fronte coronac; ιο

Dimidios, alias facies et hiantia ruptis

Ossa genia, plenos oculorum sangnine pugnos

Ludere se credunt ipsi tamen et pueriles

Exercere acies, quod nulla cadavera calcent:

Et sane quo tot rixantis millia turbae
