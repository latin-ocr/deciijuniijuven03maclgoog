He wanted ten days to complete his twenty-eighth year. A· paragraph
in the mcmoir, which is from a later haud than the first part, says he
died of adiseaee of the stomach. This is probably an invention, and
there is no other evidence of the cause of his death. From the company
he kept, his political feelings must have, been well known, and had he
lived longer he might have shared the fate of his most intimate friends,
oi whom Thrasea, Seneca, Lucanus, were put to death, and Cornutus
was banished.

He leit behind him, besides the productione of his early years above
referred to, nemore than the six Satires in this book ¹, the lust of which,
as appears plain to me from the endingen well as from the obvious
meaning of the Grammarian’s words, he must have left unfiuished.
These he probably had communicated only to his intimate friends during
his life; but alter his death, Cornutus, whom be probably left his
executor, having slightly revised the Satires, gave them to Caesius Bassus,
at his (Bassus’) nequest, to edit. Attempts have been made to trace the
corrections of Cornutus, one of those tasks that certain understandings
delight iu. The hmous line noticed by the Grammarian (S. 'a 121)
may very well have been written by Persius, ae he says; and though his
editor could not have published it without bringing disgrace and per·
haps destruction on himself, and the alteration may therefore be excused,
the verse cannot be said to have been mended by the substitution of the
words that now form part of the text. When the volume was pnblished
it immediately atuacted attention, aud was much read and admired.
Since Horace no one of any ability had put forth writings of thie kind,
and in these Satires there was found much to remind the public of their
favourite poet, combined witha great deal of originality and genius.
Persius’ intimate acquaintance with Horace's poema appears in a great
number of passages, most of which show that unconsoious imitation*
which is the surest sign of the minute study of an author. casaubon
has collected a large number of parallel passages from the two authors,
some of which may perhaps be a little strained.

' Persius is said by his biographer to bavebeen slow iu composition.
This is very likely. His verse does not flow iu a rapid and muddy
stream like that oi Lucilius, as Horace describes him (S. i. 4), but as
he says himself “ caedit pluteum et demorsos sapit ungues '' (S. i. 106).
He has evidently taken Horace's advice (S. i. 10. 69, sqq.) too literally,
aud corrected himself till his language has become short and the ideas
condensed, toa degree that makes the sense in some places obscure.
Modern readers have found great fault with the poet on this accormt.

But I think the obscurity has been exaggerated, and that, except
