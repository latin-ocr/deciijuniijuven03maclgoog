mre OF PERSIUS. xxvii

Annaeus Cornutum philosopher of the Stoic school, to which most
men of thought st that time belonged. Το Cornutus he became much
attached, and the iiiendship continued to the end of hie life. His obli-
gations ιο this excellent manha seelingly acknowledgss in the fian
Satira. While he was at school he appears to have written a comedy;
also a poem, probably of a humerous cast, which he called Ὀδοιπορικά,
Wayside Verses, or The vaeller, or whatever it may bave been, aud
some verses on the death os his kinswoman Arria. She was the wife οι
¹Caecina Paetus, who t'or treason was put ιο death by Claudius. The
allusion iu the lise is ιο her conduct οο ιιίο occasion. Paetus was
required ιο ιο his own executioner. His wife, who loved him devotedly

and had declared she would die with him, took a dagges, stabbed herself, ’

drew it out, and handed it to ber husband, and said, “ Paetus, itis not
painfirl ⁵.” This happened sn). 42,·bet'ore Persius was eight years old.
These early productione his mother kept till her death, aud then, by the
judicibus advice os Cornutus, destroyed them.

How soon after his father's death his mother married agaim it is im·
possible ιο say. But that abo remained with her two children, Aulus
and hia sister, at Volaterrae, till the boy was old enough to go to Romo,
and that ebe continued ιο superintend his education till he went to
Cornutus, may ιο assumed. The Scholiast, on S. vi. 6, says that aller
the death ol ber first husband she married in Liguria, where Persius was
staying when that Satira was written. It is more likely that she retired
to this part σι’ the country, ιο a house left her by her οοοοοά husband,
alter his death, leaving ber son to pursue his studies under the guideuoe
and roos os Cornutus ⁸.

At this time be formed an intimate acquaintance with that Caesius
Bessm to whom the last Sotira is addresaed‚ aad with Calpurnius Sura,
of whom however we know nothing more than tho Grammarian tells ue,
that he died young, and that Persius survivsd him.

⁸ See Pliny, Epp. iii. 16. Martini (i. 14) has an epigram on this event:

“Casta suo gladium cum traderet Arria Paeto,
Quem do visceribus traxerat ipsa suis,
‘Si qua fides vulnus quod feci non dolet,' inquit,
‘Sed quod tu facies hoc mihi, Paete, dolet! ''

⁸ From Persius' way of smaling of Lunae Portus it has been supposed by some that
he was born there. But independently of the express testimony of the Grnmmarian,
thera is presumptive evidence in the name οι Sisennia, which is Etruriae, and in Arria
his kinswoman haring married Caecina whose family were nativas ol Volaterrae, ιο οοο-
flrm the statement tbst Persius was horn there. Thero isos course no woight ιο ιο
attached ιο ιιο tradition which is mentioued only, as far as 1 know, in Raylo’s notice οἰ
Persius in bis Dictionary, that a modern family ol Volterra (the Palooneini) are derived
from Persius' father, vhe had botone sen, and he ‹lied numen-led. From the some
source I learn thatabouae was shown a century ago at Volterrs es that οι Persius.
