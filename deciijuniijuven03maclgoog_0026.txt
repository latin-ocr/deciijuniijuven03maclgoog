Of J uvenal’s personal character it is not so easy to form an estimate
from his writinge as it is of Horace's. That his invectivas against the
vices of his time are not the mere artistic and declamatory compositione
which some writers suppose them to be, but the fruits of an honest
indignation, of rare powers of sarcasm, and of a large knowledge of the
world, 1 think is manifest. His language is unreserved in dealing with
the foulest vices, but there is no appearance of his being himselfa looee
liver in any part of his writings. When Horace is ooarse he betrays
something cf sympathy with vioe, while Juvenal shows only contempt
for it. Although therefore an expurgated edition of Juvenal would
have more gaps than au expurgated edition of Horace, a well-regulated
mind would be less offended with the entire text of Juvenal thau with
that of Horace. J uvenal's morality was of a higher and less technical
sort than Horace's, aud has led some into the notiou that he drew it
from the purast source, and was in understandiug, if not by profession,
a Christian. This of course is absurd. He knew human nature, and
he knew right from wrong, and was not blinded by sslf-indulgence, aud
so was able to state the law of conscience iu a way to astonish some
Christiaus, to whom that lewis very imperfeotly known.

Apart fiom his morality Juvenal was a great master of words, and
had a large fund of illustration. His pictores drawn from real life, as I
have observed iu the courseof thenotes, are particularly happy: whether·
they represent the common room of a tavern‚ or the deck of a ship, or·
the iuside of a soldier’s hut or of a camp, or a schoolroom‚ or the greedy
crowd at the sportula, or the streete of Rome, or a druuken brawl, these
and ahundred other scenas are so drawn that an artist would have no
difficulty in transferring thern meanvas. But his haud must be vigorous
and his hrush fiee, or he would do no justice tc Juvenal.

There is one particular form of lust from which modern wickednees
shrinks, but which wasone of the worst evils of Roman society under
the Empire. This vice ie exposed in two Satires of great power (ii. ira).
The wickedness of women was never eo nusparingly handled as it is iu
the sixth Satira, a composition of extraordinary power and variety. The
general degradation of Roman life and manners is exposed in the first,
third, aud fourteenth Satires, and in the last of these the chief cause of
the universal wickedness is laid open in the indiffereuce of parentato
the morale of their young children, aud the example which handed down
vioe ae an inheritanee from father to sou. The degradation of the
Senate, once the fountain of honour and authority, and the proudest
