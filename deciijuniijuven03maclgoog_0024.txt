xx INTRODUCTION.

Then, or soon afterwards, Juvenal was allowed to give up his command
and retum to Rome, being at the time of his return about forty years of
age. Martial’s epigram proves that he was not altogether independent
or comfortable about this time. Nerva reigned lesa than two years, and
Trajan succeeded to the empire an). 98, and in the early part of his
reign, soon after ab. 100, Juvenal first published a volume of Satires
(of which the first in our collection wasone), having already recited them
to large audiencea. It is not unlikely that some of these, or parts of
them, had been composed in the reign of Domitian ¹, or even earlier, but
that the poet had not ventured to make them public. He continued to
write sreely during Trajan’s reign, which ended aa. 117, when Juvenal
was about sixty, and during the early years of Hadrian’a reign, that is,
till about ab. 120. During this reign he may have lived in comfort
through the liberality of the emperor, though his household was on a
frugal scale, as he tells ua in Sat. xi, from which (v. 65) we learn that
he had property at Tibur. Itis not impossible he may have lived till

· the accession of Antoninus Pius, who succeeded Hadrian am. 138, when

Juvenal was, according to this aketch, eighty ora little more.

Thus the statementaof the Grammarians in respect to the poet’s age,
and of that writer who says he died of old age in the time of Antoninus
Pius, would beborna out. 1 have also allowed the fact of an honour·
able banlshmont into Egypt, though not the cause assigned hythe
Grammarians, which is impossible. That duvenal did not professedly
compose satire till late in life, is admitted and accounted for. Likewise
that he may have written verses before he ventured to publish them,
and that some of these were afterwards incorporated with his Satires, is
allowed. It is also admitted that he attended the usual schools in early
life, and practised rhetoric till middle age. Beyond these facts the
Grammaticus 1 believe have been mialed probably by mistaken infer-
enoes drawn from allusione in the Satires themselves, a fertile source of
error and of pretended learning. on the part of the Scholiasta on all the
ancient authors.

The fact of the baniahment, though allowed as not being chronolo-
gically impossible, 1 neverthelesa think is an error, but an early one, as
is proved by a verae quoted from Sidonius Apollinaris, who believed the
whole story, including Paria' shara- in it. He wrote about the middle ol
the fifth century, and says (Germ. ix. 270, sqq.):

“ Non qui tempore Cameris amandi
detes-nocoluit Tomos reatu (ie. Orid);

Nec qui consimili deinde casu,

Ad vulgi tenuem strepentis numm,
irati fuit histrionis exuh”
