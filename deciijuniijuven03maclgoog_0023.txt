would put his birth, at the earliest, in tbe third year ο1 Nem, an. 56,
and I am inclined 1ο think that this is not far from the date. [Ribbeck
has come to the same οο111111ο1, Juvenelis Sat. Praefatio] That he
was familiar with the iniquitiee of Nero does not certainly prove that
he lived 11 his reign, aud according 1ο the above supposition he was not
more than twelve when Nero died, perhaps less. 01 Domitian he writes
with 1 contempt and loething which 11111 to be the fruit of 1 personal
acquaintance with his times, aud a memory full of disdain. That he
was of full egeln Domitian’s reign 11 certain, since he bad formed an
intimate friendehip with Martiel before the seventh book of his Epigrams
vves publiahed. That book was written 11. 93, and contains two
epigrama, one alluding, and the other addressed, to Juvenal, in terme ο1
affectionate familiarity. This alone would besufficient proof that J uvenal
was not exiled by Domitian, at any rate 1111 aster the above year, which
was ten years after the death of Paria, and not three years before
Domitian's. In Martial’e twelfth bools there ie au epigram (18) addressed
to Juvenal at Rome, Martial being at his native place, Bibilis 11 Spain.
This epigram was written between the years aur. 100 and 104, 111 long
after the accession ο1 lhajan, aud 11 supposes Juvenal 1ο be wandering
restlessly about the town and tiring himself with attendance cn great
people. If, therefore, any bauishment took place in Domitian's time,
the cause could not have been that assigned hy the Grammaticus, and
it must have been of short duration.

Adopting then such data as appear to have any probability in them,
the following may be laid down as a· sketch of Juvenals life, without
pretending 1ο accuracy, for which there are no materiale.

His name was Decius danius Juvenalis.

He was born possibly 11 Aquinum, in Latium, about the beginning of
Nero'e reign, that is soon 1111111. 64, 11 respectable parents, hia
father being 1 rich libertinus, and he himself therefore ingenuus. He
received the usual educationes a Roman bcy aud youth, as he says (S.
i. 15):

“Et uos ergo manum 1111111 subduximus, 11 noa
ffiffihffim Sullae privatus 11 altum y

111 took the ‘toga virilie’ about the beginning of Vespasien's reign,
11. 70, and having, as he says above, learnt rhetorio in the schools, he

continued to practiss 11 ae a man, not professionally, but for his own

amusement, through the reign of Vespasian and the greater part of

Domitian’s, that 11, till the year an. 94, in which year or the next he

by some means offended Domitian, and was sent by him into Egypt

with a military command, euch as civilians 11111 received during the

Empire. In un. 96 Domitian was killed aud Nerva succeeded him.
