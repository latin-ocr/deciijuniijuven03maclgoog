viii PREFACE.

. Of the English translations I have referred to, those of Dryden'
and Gilford 010 the ablest Drydeu 1100 1101 translated all the
Satires. Holydsy’s is a quaintpiece of rhyming prose, with some
learned 110100. Ηο often hits'the sense where others miss it. Dr.
J ohnson's imitatione of the third and tenth Satires 1 have notioed

111 their places. Happening to have the Italian translation by
Teodoro Accio (Lugano, 1828), I have sometimes referred to it;

and have found it, 00 101 as 1 have done so, sensible and 011011
0011001. I believe it has a high reputation in Italy.

Having edited Horaee 101 this series, I have referred freely 10 my
own notes 111 that edition. 1 hope I shall not appear egotistieal in
so doing. I must 0111101 have taken this course, or repeated almost

word for word what 1 had written before.

’ This has been found still more necessary with respect 10 Persius,
who has imitated Horace so freely 00 to eompromise his character
ror originalis, though aa aas meaa, a wal a 0010, ent 111
his own.

This author has lately been edited (Leipzig, 1843) with much
care by Otto Jahn, whose 0111110101 Juvenal 10 mentioned above.
His notes on Persius 010 in the style of Ruperti’s 011 Juvenal,
though they have more merit. Readers who wish to be referred 10
0 great variety of authors and critice, will use Jahn’s edition for
that purpose ¹. For the authors meaning Heinrich 10 0 101101 guido
in my opinion. His notes were edited at the nequest 01 his son by
Jahn the year after 1110 own edition, and seven years 01101 the death
01 Heinrich. They are shorter and 1000 elaborate even than those
ou Juvenal, but whatever Heinrich says 10 10 the purpose and the
fruit 01 bis own intelligence. 'Phe freshness 01 that 0011 01 00111-
mentary is very pleasant 10 those who have waded through a sea
01 complicated notes, in which every thing more or less remotely
bearing upon the text is vbrought in 10 1111011101 11. When arc
authors 10 be made their editors' first and only consideration 1

'lhe edition of Casaubon represents the learning 01 that great
