SA'I'IRA xvl. 359

does not amount in my opinion to ιιιιιιιιιι evidence against-tha authenticity oi the
satiro. 'ibe only MSS. from which it is distinctly said to bo absent are the two
copenhagen noticed by Heinrich, who does not mention their ages. What Lubinua '
says is only repeated from οιιιιι, whom he does not name, while if Scaliger really said
to Lubinus what he attributes to him, his opinion must ba allowed ςιιιι weight. If he
did not, then Lubinus’ word ls worth nothing. 'lhe date of the principal scholium is
uncertain, aud the observation it contains makes no ιιιιιιιιι to MSS.; end though
the Scholium shows that the satire was by many not thought to bs Juvenal's, it does
not say on what grounds they ¹⁸ erploded ” it. An opinion founded only on ιιι merita
of a work like thie would not be worth more ιι ιιι third century than now.

That the poem is complete no one can say, whether it be J uvenal's or another's,
and one who had ιιι himself tc imitate Juvenal, aud had the ability tc ιο ιι ιι well as
this writer, ιιιοι likely to have published a hugment or a composition ιο defective ιι
order and integrity ιι this. 1 do not think with Heinrich that it is bcgging the question
to asy it is only a fragment. It seems to me impossible to view ιι ιι any other light
than that of an nnllnished poem, and 1 think it may very well have been a posthumons
publication of J uvcnnl's. 1 cannot otherwise account for ιιι publication ιι all, for aa a
whole it is without point3 while neverthelees it contains some good writing worthy of
Juvenal, and might have been expanded, if the author ιιι ιιιιιιι ιι according to his
derigo, into a very amusing satire. Whoever the writer was, it is ιο ιι regretted for
historical purpoaes he did not flnish his work, for it relatas tc a subject, Roman military
life, which ιι full of interest.

Heinrich is right in aaying that ιο judge of the authenticity of a work by the style
and manner aud langusgc is unsafe, that the valna of such judgment depends on the
capacity of the critic, and that it requires peorrliar skill and natural instincte, which are
not common. But in this instance, where it ia not denied by those who think J uvenal
may be the author that ιιι work is not in the state in which if he ιιι linishcd ιι we
should now have ιιι ιι, this sort of sagacity is not wanted. 'l'he satire is in ι con·
dition in which ιο author of so much capacity would have given it ιο ιιι world who
wished ιο gain reputation by it, ιιι nc author of reputation would have published it in
his lifetime‚ though he might have made it known to his frienda The person who
wrote r. '7 (which Heinrich rejects without good reason) must hara intended to write
more on the subject that verse introduces 3 and ιι who should bring in a single exam·
ple by an exordium plainly intended for several und ιοι ιιι ιιιι hewse hungling, could
never have written the verses in which thet example ie set forth.

Ido not think then thera is sufficient reason for supposing the fragment epm-ioue, or
the partial rejectiou oi it iu early times to have procecded from any other cause than ιιι
imperfect character.

'l'he satire is in ιιι form of ιι epistle like the last, ιιι ιι professes to ιιι forth the “
ιιιιιιιςιι of ι military life, looking at it as a young man might when tired of a
cirilian's ιιιιιιιιιι. Of these edvmtugea ιιι writer instances ιιι liberty of ιιι soldier
to ιιιιιιιι civilian without any fear of ιι action for damagea for the soldier can only
be tried in camp, and if s townsman comes there for rcdress he may get a rude sort of
justice from a court-martial, but the whole camp will make him rue his revenge 'lhen
justice in civil courts is attended with many delays, while in ιιι camp it is prompt
and decisivo. Resides which ι father hus no power over hia son's military asminge, und
the soldier cau make a will of hia own.

‘l'hie is literally the whole of the satire. It is ιι much a satire upon the camp ss the
town, and so probably it would have been carried out in ι ιιιιιι] of compar-icona
between the soldier aud civilian. assuming Juvenal ιο be tha author of the satire we
need not imagine (aa the old commentatore did) any particular circumstances having
given riae to it. The subject is one that might have suggested itsalf to any one, and
