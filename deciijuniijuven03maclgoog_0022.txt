xviii INTRODUQTION.

is referred to as having ‘nuper’ stripped the Africans. But ‘nuper' is
used with much latitude, and the name of Marius was long held in
remembrance ae the great spoiler of provinces, haring been made more
notorious through the celebrity of Tacitus the historian aad Pliny the
younger, who were employed to prosecute him, just as the speeehes of
Bnrke and Sheriden against Warren Hastings hare papatuated and
spread the ill-same of his Indian government.

It is certain that the fourth Satira was written after the death of
Domitian, au. 96, since his death is expressly mentioned in the last two
verses. This Satire therefore may be assigned to the reign of Nerua
ο from September, au. 96, to J auuary, an. 98, οι· very early in his suc·
cesscr Trajan’s reign. The subject would only amuse soon after the
tyranus death.

The twelfth Satira, which refers to Trajan’s basin in the Portus
Augusti (v. 75, dic), mimt have been written in his reign cr after it.
This argument assumes what there is no good reason to doubt, that the

According to these calculatione eight out of the sixteen Satires were
written alter the death of Domitian. The sixteenth is a fragment, and ι
it may be admitted that, if not the last written, it was not begua very
long before the last, whicherer that may have been. Thus more than
half the extant Satires were written, as I suppose, between au. 96 and
an.120‚0r some of thern possibly a little later, a period of at least
twenty-four years.

If any credit is due to the statement of the Grammarians‚ in which
they all agree, that Juvenal did not begin to write in this style till he
was near middle life, we may suppose that ncne of the Satires were
written much before the death of Domitian. We cannot tell how long

the vigorous spirit that appears in all these poems may last, and show

' itselfiu compositione of this sort. It is no argument to say that Horace

soon got tired of Satira. His mind and circumstances were very diffe-
rent from J uvenal’s. But twenty-four years after the period of middle

life carries a man on to an age when, under almost any circumstances,
the mind loses its freshnees and secks rest, at least horn the excitament

ossuch compositions; and I think Juvenal could not hare been more

than fcrty‚ and probably not so much, when Domitian died. This may
be affirmed whether the Grammariaus have stated the truth on the
above point or not, if my calculatione are not altogether wrong. This
