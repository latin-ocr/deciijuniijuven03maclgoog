D. JUNII JUVENALIS

'lbrpe peras, ne tu pueri contempseris annos,
Sed peccaturo obsistat tibi filius infans.
Nam si quid dignum Censoris feccrit ira 50

Quandoque et similem tibi se non corpore tantum

Nec vultu dederit, morum quoquc filius et qui

Omnia deterius tua per vestigia peccet,

Corripies nimirum et castigabis acerbo

Clamore ac post haec tabulas mutare parabis. ⁵5

Unde tibi frontem libertatemque parentis

Quum facias pejora senex, vacuumque cerebro

Hospite venturo cessabit nemo tuorum.
