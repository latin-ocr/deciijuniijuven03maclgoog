Arbor, et ejectis mendicat silva Camenis.

In vallem Aegeriae descendimus et speluncas

Dissimiles veris. Quanto praestantius esset

Numen aquae, viridi si margine clauderet undas

Herba nec ingenuum violarent marmora typhum. ao
Hic tunc Umbricius, Quando artibus, inquit, honestis
Nullus in Urbe loeus, nulla emolumenta laborum,

Res hodie minor est here quam fuit, atque eadem eras
Deteret exiguis aliquid, proponimus illuc

Ire fatigatas ubi Daedalus exirit alas, 25
Dum nova canities, dum prima et recta senectus,

Dum superest Lachesi quod torqueat, etpedibus me
