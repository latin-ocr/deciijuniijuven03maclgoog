SATIRA 11. 223

'l'hs most corrupt moy therefore well despice these morelists, ond turn tho tables on
them, ss Leuronis did when she hesrd one cry i'or the J nlinn lnwr ⁴⁸0 hsppy timos
(cried she) with such e bulwsrk for ite morsis! Let the town blusb, snother Ceto is
come down from heaven! But whence, prny, this perfnmsryl llyou nonst osll old
lnws up from their rest, you'd better summon tho Scantinisn tlrst. Iaook nt the mon,
for they ure worse then we, bnt their comperet errey snd numbers seve them; the
lewd will bnug together: smong us nought so detsstnble is found. Sey, do we moddlo
with tholorum ond the lnws? A few, snd but slew, ere soen in theercns. Eut you
will sit snd spin end do our women's work better, yos then the best ol us. We sll
know who wos Hister's heir, end hy whst complsissnoe his wife got rich ι sud others
moy do likewiss. And yet we ers condemnedr end censure speres tho raven to hunt
down the dose.” These Stoice fied confused before the trnih of hor robuke.

V. 65. What will not others do whcn yon put on those clothes ol gaure end go snd
presoh before sdnriring crowds ogsinst the female sinners, Creticus? 'l'hcy would et
locst put on ι decent toga il it cerne to thet. “ But it is so hot,'' sny you: why then
go nsked ς· msdness is less disgrscelnl. Look ιι tho dress in which, hed you lived
then. onr hnrdy sncestors had seen you in tho rostro. Would yon not cry out,
“ Henren and eurth ι’ if you snw s judex so ettired? How would ιι witness look in
clothes like these? And yct yon, stern nnbending Stoic, go transpnrent !

V. 78. 'l'be infection hes spread, end will larther spread, like mur-rein among sheep. or
scurt’ in pige, or contagione rot lrom grspe to grnpe. Yon will go on to something
worse than this. The height of wickeduess is reached by slow degrees. Soon we
shall soe you smong those who mock the rites of Bono Dor, driving out the women,
snd koeping up such orgios ns the Boptne tire Cotytto with. 'I'hey wear long gerlando
on their hesds end jowels on their neck, snd sacrifice, ond pour libatione. Here one
peinis his eyehrows ond makes his eyes look hnguuhing: another drinks lrom en
obscene glnss with his long looks tied np in s net ol gold, with s hsndsorne tunic,
while his slsve swesrs by his muster‘s luno! Another holds s mirror to his leco such
ss vile Otho osrried when ho went to the wnrs; s novel picco ol lurniture l'or ο camp !
of course it iss grest men’s psrt to kill n tyrsnt-nnd to mind his skin ; to sim st
empireo -nud to smooth his lnce. Semiramis sud Cleopatra did not so. llere is no
reverence for the nole, nonoy but Cybele’s foul licencs sud the longuishing voice, e
fannio high priest with his white hair, rnre glutton he und master ofhis ert. Long
since they should hsve cut their useless parts, es the Phrygien priests ore wont.

V. 117. Gracchus his portion brought to s trumpeter: the mnrrisgcdeeds weresigned;
the blessing spoken ς the lenst prepared ; tho now bride ley upon his hnsbsnd'sbosorn.
Ye nobles! need we the censor or tho haruspex here? What if s women estred or s
oow lsmbedl' you'd shudder moro snd count them greater munstero. 'l'he priest of
Mers who swested with the ancilis puts on sbridsl dress! Gradivus, whence this
shsme to Intin shepherdsl whence heve tby sons this itch? A msn of birth ond
weslth marries s mon, end yet thy wreth is still! quit then the plain which thou dost
so neglect. “I must he up bctinres, end do my duty by the Quirino1.'' “thtdutyl”
“What duty! why my friend will tnke s husband-tho merrisgs will be private.'’
Βιιι soon there'll he no pdonoy, theyll eveno to put it in tho news. And yet they
must die herren (this torments thern), in spite of herbe end tho Lupercus' blows.

V. 14³. Bnt this is less thou noble gledistors, who soour the uene, better horn thnn nll
the line l'olk who look on by tho podium, yco thou tho grest rnen too who gives the
gemes. Tho fsblos nbont menes, Styx, ond Cheron’s bont we leuve to bobes. But
only think thom true, and what would nll those mighty spirits sny when such s
rhode estne down! They'd cry sor lustrnl water, sulphur, pino, ond lnurcl.

v. 159. So changed ere we, oles! Onr arms ere carried to the furthest North, hut those
