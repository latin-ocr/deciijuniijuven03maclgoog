I have not thought it right to omit any part of these Satires.
'l'hc character of the writers is scen throughout, and the spirit even
of the coarsest parte is menifestly that of virtue. I have had some
experience of boys, and I believe that those are exceptione on '
whom such passages as are usually expunged¹ are likely to have an
injurioue effect. Wantonnces is one thing, and the stern reproof
of wantonness in terms it best understands is another, aud few
minds fail tc see the differencc. I have thought it enough to pass
over the worst passages without comment.

Hc who is occupied with the labours of two professione, the ceres
of a large family, and the unavoidable distractione of a town lise,
may claim some indulgence for the delecte ol awork requiring much
attention aud a clear judgment at every point, and sor the execution
of which only a limited time could be allowed. Ι have done
the best I could under the circumstances for studente and general
readers of Juvenal and Persius, that they may bc ableto understand
aud talre au interest in those writers, especially the former, who has
great charms for all that can appreciate a vigorous mind and Stoical
integrity. In this taslr Iam thanksul to have had the advice and
sympathy of my friend, Mr. George Long.
