SA'I'IRA XIV. 313

Perfidus, et nigri potietur carceris uncum, ιιι
Aut maris Aegaei rupem scopulosque frequentes
Exsulibus mugnis. Poens gaudebis amara

Nominis invisi, tandemque fatebere laetus

Neo surdum nec Tiresiam quenquam esse deorum.

SATIRA XIV.

INTRODUOTION.

'ihus satire contains some golden rnles end is throughout written iu Juvenol’s best
style. lt exposce one of the radiosi causes ol the prevailing immorality, which wss the
contagione exemplo ond had teaching of parents, scting from their earliest years upon
their children. Inavicious homo nothing but vice con be learnt: the sin ofthe lether
is visited upon the son becsuae the sou contracte sud exaggerasse the lether’s vices: tho
gsmoeter begete gamestsrse the licentiose teget profligstes ς the spendthritt is the
father os spendthristo and the miser of misere 3 partly hom the force of inlection end
partly because tecchingconnot as ι general rnle rise obove practice, and he who parades
his nults beforehis child cannot even reprove that child if he adopts theru. 'lbere is
not n more pregnant sentence iu any outhor than that, “Maximo debetur pueris
reverentia” Itis a truth which the better instincta of mankind st once eolnovvledge,
and it oonld not heve been better expreseed or supported iu more dignifled languege
thr-n Juvenal has hese used. It would heve been plessent is his experience or the scope
of his satire hsd odmitted of his drawing a picture of a home in which vinno grows
hy the same means as vioe' grows by in others, and showing ns how domestic exemple
and the influenoo of a hsppy home act on the ohsracters of men and the well-being ol
society. ·

'I'ne inherited vices J uvcnsl speaks of are guming, luxorions living, violence of temper,
contempt for inferiore, sensuality,e1trsvsgsnoe, superstition, end svaricc. 'l'hc greater
part of the satire is taken up 'with the last, and the love oi getting, for the sele of
hovingor for display, is treoed thom its earliest impressiou on the young mind, to which
in general itis not natural, through injustice, selflshness, crime, and danger, to the
miserebis auxiety that waits upon possession after all hss been done to secure it. Once
only he touches shortly on the influenoe of mothers’ example ou their daughters. 'l'here
isas might beexpocteds reference to the simplicity of the olden time, end there ere one
or tvo pictores, as of the anxious host (v. 59, sqq.) end tho soldier's family (166, sqq.)
such as Juvenal sketches with peculias power.

ARGUMENT.

Theseis many au sct of ioul repert, Fuscinus, leaving its stain for ever on young mindo,
vhich parents tesoh their children both by precept end example. 'l'he old man
gsmoe, his hoy too shakes the dice. What hope is these ol him who learns in youth
to seaeou lig-pectere and mashrooms, taught by his iether? Give him a thou·
