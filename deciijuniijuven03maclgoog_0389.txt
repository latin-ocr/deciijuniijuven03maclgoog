SATIRA XV.

INTRODUCTION.

'l’nra satire must have been written atter J uvenal’s residence in Egypt. Under what
circumstances be wentto that country there is not sufficient authority for sayingwith any
certainty. In v. 27 there is an allusion which gives fair ground for suppcaing that the
poem was written in the reigu of Hadrian (see note). It turns upon a case said to have
happened not long before. 'lhe people ol Ombi (v. 35), a town in Upper Egypt, wor- χ
shipped tha crocodilo, while those oi Tentyra (nearly a hundred miles lower down the
Nile) were opposedtotbat worship, and ware particularly distinguished'lcrdlieir skill and
coursge in lrilling the crocodile. 'lhis caused a send between the two peoplea, and while
the Ombites were celebrating a religione festival the Tentyritescamc and attached them.
The Omhitea were pnt to flight, and tbc Tentyrites are represented as haring caught one
oi them andin their fnry having caten him up. Thia story gives occasion fora good deal
oi strong contemptuose writing against the Egyptians, their religion and morals,a virid
description oi the above aavage ecana, set off by some ilna lines on the more tendet
instincta of burnan nature, and the ties ot' sympathy that unite mankind. The principal
subject is resolting, and it was not possible to malie itone of general intereat. It seems
as it'tbe story, whether true or not, bad been repeated to Juvenal and had called up all
tha prejudices a residcnce among these peopla bad created in hia mind. His power in
alectching soenes from real life has been seen in the course oi these satiras, and here we
have a picture on a larges scale drawn with a strong and rough hand, anch as nearly all
bis pictnoes show.

The Satira ia addressed to Volusius Bithynicna, whoever he may have been. Perhaps
he is no more than a name.

ARGUMENT.

All know, Volusius, themonsters Egypt worships 3 here 'tisthe crocodilo, the ibis thera i
tbe long-tailed ape at 'l'hehes where Memnon strikoe hia lyra. Cata, river-hah, anddcgs
(bnt not Diana). Oniona and leeks no tooth may herm. 0 holy peopla, whose gods
grow in their gardana! A sheep or goat they may not eat, but human flesh they
may. When once Ulysses told such marvellons tales to Alcinous and bis gnests, some
inore sober than the raet no doubt were wroth and would have thrown him into tha
sea, with hia talea about ansnygones and Cyclops. His Scylla andhia elashing rocks
