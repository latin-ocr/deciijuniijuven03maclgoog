ι. Anisus Connurus, to whom this satire is oddressed, us etsted in the Introduction,
was the instructores Persius, who went to him es soon ss he eume ιο mau's estate, to
leam the Stolo philosophy. Ηο ures s native oione ottho two phoes in Libys named

His nsme shows him ιο heve ιοοο u heuman of one of the Αοοοοὶ, oi which family
there were msny wealthy branchos. Seneos was one oi them, und was s friend oi
Cornutus. The poet Lucan was an Annaeus, sud ons of his pupils. Dion Cassius
(62, ο. 29) seys that Nero, intending ιο write ο Roman history in lipie verse, consulted
Cornutus ss ιο ιιο number ol' books it should ιο in. Some of his liutterers told him they
should ιο four hundred, but Cornutus said no ons would need thern. And when ιοοιο
one said Chrysippus, the Stoic, had written muuy more, Cornutus auswered that his
books had something usciul in thern ior human liic. Whereuporr Nero sent him into
exile. This must have been siber the doeth oi Persius, nn. 62. According to ,lemme
it wesin 68, the nst year oi Nero's reign, [but according ιο Dion it was before the
consulship oi Telesinus, und therefore before ino. uu]

The Sotira turns upon the character und teaching oi Cornutus. It is supposed ιο ιο
delivered in conversation with him, end the introductioh is well arranged. Persiu.
begins by referring to the commonplaceof poete eskingthehiuse fora hundred tongues;
end Cornutus aske what he eun be about, end hopes he is not going to write atrugedy
or an lipic poem. lle suswers thet he wunts this gith of tongues to tell his sffection
end gratitudo towards his hiend snd toacher, whom he sddresses iu effectionute lun·

the seme stan Ηο contracte the eur-nest liic of his muster, devoted ιο study and to
the instruction ofthe young, with ιιο νοτίοιο selfish porsuits of tho world 5 and he
tulres that opportunity to urge upon old and young the study of philosophy. Οοο of
the tenete of the Stoice is thst which is dwelt upon at length in the seventh satire of
Horace’s second book, und in the nith oi Cicero’s Pandora, of which the title is irs
pinos ι voees ἐλεύθερος rol πᾶς ἄφρον δοῦλος. Toking up this doctrine Persius occupies y
the rest of his Satine with illustratione oi it, showing thot real liberty is not thot oi
the siuve set free by tho Praetor, though with his freedom he may get the world to
worship him, and fancy he is at liberty to live us he pleases. 'I'hese notione ιο treets
ss oid vives’ tales ς for the Proetor cannot teaeh a man the doties oi liis and how ιο
enjoy it, sny more than he ean touch s low fellow to plsy the herp. Α man cannot do
what hs pleases, for he cun only do whst he is dt for. If he is upright, aud disoeruing,
end Just, aud moderete, and kind, and liber-sl without extravagance, and hee fmm
evurioe, he is airee man; but if not, ιο is as much a siuve as the man that carries his
master-’s things to the bath, and is hogged ir he loiters on the wsy. 'l'here are those,
he goes ou to ssy, who are slsvos alternately oi svurioe sud seli-indulgence, but who
believe themselves i'ree notwithstanding. The youth who has summoned eourage to
give up his mistress aster she hes ill-treated him, and thinks he is going to leod a new

men is the slave oi the mob, the superstitious oi his feurs und of the kuuves thet impose
u u him.
