texts differ, and 1 find a great many in which Macleane’s text 10 001101

than that 01 Jahn, who has introduced semebad readings. Ihave
observed a few passages 10 which 1 should prefer Jahn's text, but on

the whole I think the Englishman has shown more good sense 0011
judgment than the German.

lhave added in the 00100 nearly all the variatione of Ribbeck’s text.
Many of Ribbeck's variatione are the same as Jahn's, but he has 0001001

010 own, and most of them 00001 10 100 0011. Some of his transpositione
improve the text, 001 10001 01 10001 110 not. He has handlcd the sixth

it would require much time and study to pass 0 just judgment 00 010

1 have made many small corrections in Mr. Macleane's notes, where
thore was some slight error or mis-statement, but I have omitted nothing
and altered nothing which I believe the editor would 001 have omitted

points, and would both have omitted and altered much 10010 1000 Ῑ 0ον0

numerous, and the canses 01 011010 10100 figures 01 such references are

0 few slight errore since this book was printed, but they are not such as
to require any particular notice. Ι have added a little in the notes here

Ihave made are marked thus[ ]. ¹
