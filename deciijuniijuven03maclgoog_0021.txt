Ι LIF'E OF JUVENAL. , xvii

away, for it was written shortly aller the consulship of Junius, and
therefore, if Sabinus be the man, in the middle or towards the beginning
of Domitian's reign. But it will be shown below that the banishment
could not have happened till late in Domitian’s reign, and I believe
Hadrian’s consul, Junius Rusticus, is meant, and that the Satire was
written early in Hadrisn’s reign, that is about no. 121, or two years,
after the consulship of Junius ⁸.

In Sat. xiii. 17 he speaks of Calvinus, the friend he addresses, ast
then sixty years old, aud born iu the consulship of Fonteius. I·think
it almost certain that the consul referred to is L. Fonteius Capito, cos.
ao. 59, and that therefore the Satira was written towards the be-
ginning of Hadrian's reign, and not earlier than no. 119.

The earlier date to which Lipsius aud others refer it, as stated in my
note (xiii. 17), is sowy-seven years belbre the reign of Hadrian.
Either, therefore, Juvenal did not write at all in that reign, or this
Satira was written while Hadrian was emperor, about no. 119.
Otherwise Juvenal's Satires must range over a period of fifty years or
thereabouts, and one of the very best must have been nearly the earliest.
Those who are of opinion that the allusion to Meroe in v. 163 of this
Satira, resulted from personal observation, must be prepared to admit
the later date, or to suppose that the banishment of Juvenal to Egypt
by Domitian is altogether fabulous, aud that his visit to that country
must hare been early in the reign of Vespasian‚ if not before it, since
the Satire, according to the other hypothesis, must hare been written
about the fourth year of that reign, and nine years before Domitian
became emperor.

Thus the sixth, seventh, thirteenth, and fifteenth Satireshave intercal
evidences by which they may be referred to the reign of Hadrian, and
of these the three last, Ι hare no doubt, were written under that
emperor.

But if we take nn. 120 as the latest date of which there is evidence,
how far back may we go to determine the author’s age iv

It is nearly certain that th'e first Satira was written in Trajan’s reign,
not long aster the banishment of Marius Priscus, nn. loo

The reference to war on the Euphrates in the eighth Satire (v. 51)
makes it probable that the poem was written during the Armenion and
Parthian wars (no. 114-116), in the course of which (an. 115)

⁸ Ruperti, 1 think, is right in saying “ Satira xv. hoc forte anno scripta (121) non
superiore, narn si tarn recens factum esset quod in ea narrat, poeta opinor v. 2⁷ simpli-
citer dixisset ‘napea' neque adjecisset ‘Consule J unio ' ’³ (V ita J uu. per annos digesta,
roh i. p. xxx). This commentator thinks that Juvenal, now in his. eighty·flrst year, was
