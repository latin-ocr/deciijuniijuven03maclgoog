290 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

woman's cry: no sensible man thinks οι that: what gccd would it dc ιι ιο could tortnrc ,
ιιο ιοοο ιο ἁοοιιι Resides, ιι ιο wanted revenge there was conscience ιο dothet work

disturhing his sleep, adding terror ιο ιιο thunder and despair ιο delineas, hinderiug his
prayers end standing sor ever between himself sndthc gods he hes offended. No tear οι
his repentiugt nature will he ιοο strong ior him, and will go beck ιο the guiltthet oon·
science has condemncd3 end so he will gc from sin ιο mmcrse, and back again to sin,
till οι last ιο will bc caught inhia own snare, end come ιο ιιο punishment οιιιο ιοιοο,
and prove to the satisfacticn οι ιιο vindictive sonl that the gods cre neither deal nor blind.
· Τιο satire takes the form οι expostulation end ironical consolation throughout. It ie
most familisrly known ns dealing with the subject οι en accueing conscience, which it does
in every powerful way fromv. 192 tc 2³5. But this is only one pontof ιιο whole. 'lhc
character οι ιιο times andthccontrast οι ιιο past and present occnpy much οι ιιο poem,
end there is a very due pasmge desoribing the wey in which men temper with guilland
argue themselves into the commission οι ιι. and put cn a bold face as οι innocence, hum
v. 86 ιο 119.

Gifl'crd says, “Juvenal is here almost sentietur? and hc speaks οι ιιο doctrines ωο-
taincd in this satire ‘⁴ as οι such pure, such sublime morality '⁹ as “ the light οι nature
alone was incapsble οι discovering 5 end which the author undoubtedly derived from that
‘true light ' which now began ιο glimmer through the Roman world.” sud move ιο that
effect. 1 have made a remark euthia subject in one οι ιιο notes (v. 209). Βοι ιαιιο
chronological difficulty there ure many who would say that the seme light glimmered ln
the mind οι Socrates, whose views οι ιιο snpervisidn οι (lod and the power οι musolanos
vvere not less clear than J nveual's, though we hove no such powerinl exposition οι ιιο

ideas ss we have hore. 'l'here never was n time when conscience did not exist in the ο

mind οι man, however completelythe habit οι gnilt may have secred it in some aud have
given a colonr οι innocense to wickedness in the judgmcut οι whole communities. What
Juvenal says οο ιιο subject οι conscience derives ita only weight hcm its truth; end
though he exaggerates when helesds ιο ιιο inierence that the stings οι a guilty conscience
must necessarily icllow guilt, the picture he drawa is taken from experiencc‚ not from
revelation, the experience οι those who were nc Christiana end had nc knowledge ιο
srighten them but that which vves suggested from within. 'I'hc sclilcqny (v. 92-105) in

whichaman urgues awaythcmisgivings with whiohhoentersuponcrimeorthcdenisl οι ο

it, represents no doubt the conduct and feelings οι many who hove more light thau that οι
conscience ς but theretoc the men is not s bod Christian, bnt a bad pagan ; sud ιι we are
surprised to read in Juvenal langnage or sentiments which ιι delivered hum a Christian
pulpit wculdhe appropriate and searching, it is because wo ere apt tc forget that human
nature, with its dcsires, its corruptions, und its sels-deceptione, has always bcen the sama
iu tho main,and thet (iod ιιο never been without his witness against guiltinthe hmrtoi
men. 'lhat revengc ie nnphilcscphical and vindictivcucss the proof οιο little mind msy
bc offirmcd without more light than man has always possessed. But this doctrine in par·
ticular ιι is οι which (lidord declares that “neither Thales nor Chrysippus, no, nor ιιοΙ
great master Zeno ever taught or even conceived ” it How does hckucw thiel Hedoes
not add that Socrates did not act upon it, ss Juvenal (who does not look to Ohristinnity
ιοι· his examples) says he was ready ιο dc. And ιι ιο acted the doctrine he pveached
it, as, ιι Ριοιο ιο ιο ιο trusted, ιο equally did ιο words ι or if hc did οοι Ριιιο did it for
him, and that comcs ιο thesaure thing. η
The snm οι this is that the reader had better take up this satire as representing the
common moral sense οι mankind, und look ιο the lew οι Christianity as confirming ιιο
nnwritten law οι which conscience has always been the guardien and thcespcneut, sud
of which such writings as J uveual's, especially this poem, arethe clearest evidence.
Ruperti hos pointed cut what he considers detecte in this sative. Ηο says that the
