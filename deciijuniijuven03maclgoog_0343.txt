SATIRA XIII. .

Hos quoqne felices qui ferre incommode ritae

Nec jactare jugum rite didicere magistra.

Quae tam feste dies ut cesset prodere furem,

Perfidiam, fraudes, etque omui ox crimine lucrum
Quaesitum, et partos gladio vel pyxide nummos? 25
Ruri quippe boni: numerus vix est totidem quot
Thebarum portae vel divitis ostia Nili.

Noua aetus egitur pejoraque secula ferri

Temporibus, quorum sceleri non invenit ipse

Nomen ct e nullo posuit nature metello. eo
