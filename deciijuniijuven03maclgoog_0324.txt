Idaeum sollemne, colunt, similisque triumpho

Praeda caballorum Praetor sedet ac, mihipace ιιι
Immensae nimiaeque licet 'si dicere plebis,

Totam hodie Romam Circus capit et fragor aurem
Percutit eventum viridis quo colligo panni:

Nam si deficeret moestam attonitamque videres

Hanc urbem, veluti Cannarum in pulvere victis ιοο
Consulibus. Spectent juvenes, quos clamor ct audax

Nostra bibat vernum contracta cuticula solem
Effugiatque togam. J am nunc in bulnca salva

Fronte licet redas, quanquam solida bora supersit sos
Ad sextam. Facere hoc non possis quinque diebus
Continuis, quia sunt talis quoque taedia vitae
