scholar( It has been lately republished by Dnebnar (Leipzig, 1839),
with the text revised but not improved by this editor, who hae
added to Casaubon's notes the conflicting opinions of other eom-
mentators. The notes 01 Lubinus are so wordy and embarraseed
as to be quite unreadable. Plum and Koenig have sumished the
world with long commentarics, 01 which Plum's is the better. Pas-
sow’s edition (Leipzig, 1809) is accompanied by a German trans-
lation, and a commentary in the same language on the first Satira.
In cases of difficultyI have not been able to rely upon his judg-
ment. Orelli has given the text, scholia, and many 01 the various.
readings 01 Persius in his Eclogae Poetarum Latinorum. His text
isgood, and 1 have never failed to consider it with respect. Every
editor who thinks aa he ought, independently, will have his own
opinion 01 his author’s meaning3 and so will choose‚ out 01 many
that may have authority, that reading which best represents his
opinion. With this remark I disclaim any want 01 proper defercnce
to the scholarship 01 others more learned than myself. Scholarship
(of a certain sort) and learning do not always go along with judg-
ment3 sometimes they tend to obscure it ς nor are all editore
learned that contriwc to seem so.

· The scholia on this author, publiehed with great carc by Jahn,
are more numerous than those on Juvenal. They passed among
scholars 01 the early time as the production of oue person, and he
no other than Annaeus Cornutus, the teacher 01 Persius. It does'
not require much discrimination to see that they are not from that
source, and do not contain a syllable that was written near the tima
01 the poet. Jahn has taken great paine to show that they are 111οΓ η
work 01 a later Cornutus of the tenth century, who wrote a com-¹
mentary also on J uvenal. If thisbe so, he may have used notes 01
earlier Grammarians than himself without acknowledgment. There
isa great deal 01 ‘nseful and a great deal 01 foolish matter in these
scholia.

Of the MSS. 01 Persius J ahn has mentioned and described sixty-
seven, of which the most memorable are a fragment of the first
Satira, edited by Mai from the famous Vatican Palimpsest, and
two others 01 the ninth and tenth centurias which bear an ,inscrip-
