LIIlE OF PERSIUS.

Tun principal facts of Persius’ life may be gatbered from a memoir of
which the following is a translation. The author, hy some supposed to
be Suetonius, munet be conjectured with probability. It appears in
mestos the old MSS. of Persius, and in some of the oldest is said to be
extraoted from a commentary of Valerius Probus. That name is giren
to other memoirs besides this, and whether it represents one, or two, or
several early Grammarians, ie uncertain. There is no doubt however
that the account is very old, aud the statements have an air of truth
which is confirmed by internal evidence. There is little iu Persius’
writings on which to construet an imaginary biography, and this is so
far a guarantee for the genuineness of this Grammarian's facts.

. “Aulus Persius Flaccus was born the day before the nones of December,

in the consulship of Fabius Persicus and L. Vitellius ¹. He died the
eighth day before the kalends of December, in the 'consulship of P.
Marius and Asinius Gallus¹. He was born [in Etruria'], at Volaterrae,
a Roman eques, by blood and meninge connected with men of the
highest ranlr. He died at the eighth milestone on the Appian read, on
his own estate. His father Flaccus leit him a minor, about six years
old. His mother Fulvia Sisennia afterwards married Fusius, a Roman
eques, and him too she buried within a few years. Flaccus pursued his
studies until his tweltth year at Volaterrae 3 aster that at Rome with
· the grammarian Remmius Palaemon, and the rhetorician Virginius
aarum. When he was sixteen years old he first began to enjoy the
friendship of Annaeus Cornutus, to whom he became so much attached
that he never leit him, and by him he was initiated to a certain extent
iu philosophy. He had for his friends irem his earliest youth, Caesius
Bassus, and Calpurnius Sura', who died young during Persius' lifetime.
