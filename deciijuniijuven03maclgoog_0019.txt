that the emperor in a despateh addressed to him with the army, wrote
these words, “et te Philomela prumovit” (alluding to his own epigram),
and that, learning from this the anger ol* the emperor, he died of a
broken heart.

The sixth memoir makes 'Ihajan the emperor, Paria being still the
hero of the epigram, and agrees with the fifth about Seotland.

A seventh agrees substantially with the first, except that the emperor
is said to have been Nero.

These seren are published at the end of Jahn’s edition.

It seems clear that not one of these notioes is original. They have
oome, and that not at drot hand probably, from two or three common
stoolrs, which hare been eonlounded aeoording to the fanoy of the
writer 3 aad whatever amount ol* truth there may hare been in the
originale hae been perverted 'aud eonfused in the later editions, which

The only authority l'or iuvenale birthplaee eontaiaed in his poems is
in Sat. iii. 319, where his friend says, “quoties te Roma tuo reliei pro·
parantem reddet Aquino.'’ But this only shows that Juvenal was in
the habit ol' frequenting that town. Persius (S. vi. 7) speaks of the sea
on the Ligurian ooast aa ‘meum mare‚‘ beeause he was staying there at
the dme, but no one now infers from this that he was born on that
ornet& Where Juvenal was born therefore is unoertain ⁸, and the
timaei his birth ia equally so.

That he wrote as late as the reign of Trajan, who sueoeeded Nerva
aa. 98, ia oertain irum the allusion in the first Satira (r. 47), aud the
eightlr (v. 120) to the crimea aad banishment oi Marius Priscus, whose
exile took plaee an. 100.

Another prool is that, in Sat. xii. 75, he refers to the inser basin of
the Portus Augusti, oonstruoted by Trajan. [If Juvenal wrote this
Satire, tha eonelueion irem the text ia une ς aad if he did not, the passage

1n Sat. vi. 502, there is en allusion te the way ladies wore their hair,
whieh seems to show that this Satira was written in the reign ol Trajan,
or early iu that of Hadr'nn (aaa nota).

In r. 407 ol' the same satire, Lipsius traoes a referenoe to tho redue-
tion ol Armenia to the condition of a Roman province, by the same
emperor, iu ab. 106. This argument however has not much lorea.
