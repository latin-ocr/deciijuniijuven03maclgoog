SATIRA 1v.

Seriolas veterem metuens deradere limum

Ingemit, ‘Hoc bene sit l' tunicatum cum sele mordens ιο
Caepe et, farratam pueris plaudentibus ollam,

Pannosam faecem morientis sorbet aceti ?”

'At si unctus cesses et figas incute solem,

Est prope te ignotus cubito qui tangat, et acre

Despuat in mores, penemque arcanaque lumbi 35
Runeantem populo marcentes pandere vulvae:

“ Tu cum maxillis balanatum gausape pectas,

Inguinibus quare detonsus gurgulio extat?

Quinque palaestritae licet haec plantaria vellant,
illinesque nates labefactent forcipe adunca, ιο
Non tamen ista filix ullo mansuescit aratru.''
