PREFACE. vii

nothing to recommend him. He has horrowed without echnow·
ledgmeut from Ruperti ς so at least that editor says. His remarks
are very feeble. He has added iu a seperate volume notes more
valnable thau his own by the two brothers Valesii, written st the
end of the seventecnth century, but never before published entire.
He also had access to a large number of MSS. in the imperial
library at Paris. How he used them his references ere too general
to enable the reader to judge. The only English edition I have hed
occasion to notice is one by Mr. Meyer (Cambridge, 1853) ‚ intended
for the use of schools; the chief feature of which is 11 lerge compila-
tion, from various sources, of references to other authors, classieal
and ecclesiastical, some given as quotations, but most by reference
te the places in which the passages are te be found. Γ11111 object of
this is said to be ‘⁸ to rescue certain suthors from undeserved con·
tempt” 'Phe authors meant are those later than the Augustan
age. whether they are held in undeserved contempt, or whether
this commentery bas helped to rescue them, Ido not know. Mr.
Meyer does not approve of Heinrich, and from thenature of his
own commentery itwas not te be expected that he would. His
text professes to be that of Jahn, “except in orthography and
punctuation.’' In his interpretation when he has an opportunity
he follows the judgment of Madvig, in whose Opuscula there are
two essays in which some passages of Juvenal are commented upon.
With all respect for that eminent scholar, 1 do not thinlr the inter-
pretation of Juvenal was quite in his way. lhave mentioned his “
opinion in several places. 'Phe names of (frangereris, Britannicus,
Herminius, and other scholare of the sixteenth and seventecnth
centeries, will be found in these notes. Their commentarios, in
part er entire, are collected in a thick quarto volume, publishcd at
Leyden by Herminius in 1695, which book Ruperti calls “indi-
gestam vanae speciosaeque dochinse farraginem, rudemque rerum
inutilium molem.” It contains much thetis wrong and a great deal
thetis good, and Ruperti need not have despised it. 'Phe edition of
Lubinus (Hanover, 1603) I have had by me. Ruperti looks upon

him as “ verbosus nugator.'’ He was a learned meu and the friend ,

of learned men, und often understood J uvensl where Ruperti did not.
