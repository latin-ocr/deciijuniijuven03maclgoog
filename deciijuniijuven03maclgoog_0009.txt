PREFAOE.

——u--n

As in the ease of Horaoe, there hasbeen eolleted a sufficient num·
her of good MSS. of Juvenal 1ο supply a satisfactory text without
resorting to oonjeotme5 and I believe there is authority from MSS.
or scholia for all 11ιι readings Ι have adopted. Thai MS. 1ο which
most weighl is, perhaps deservedly, attached is commonly ealled
tho Codex Budensis ,having been originally ιιι 11ιι royal library 31

Bada, ιιι Hungary. Where 11 rs now, isunlrnown 11 rs referred ·
1ο ιιι these notes aa P lrom Pithoeus (Pithon), on whose collation,
towards the end of the sirleenth century, our knowledge of 11
chiefly depende. Ι1 had before been used with less care by Valla,
whose edilion was firsh published 31 Venice arentury earlier (1486). ·

From this MS.¹ eopious scholia were published by these editors,
and they are referred 1ο generally as ‘ 11ιι Soholiast' in this and
other editions. But they are nol all from 11ιι same hand They
have been carehilly edired by Heinrich and Sehopen, and still
more so by Cramer (Hamburg, 1823), who founda MS. ι1 Sl.
Gallen,1n Switzerland, containing 11ιι same, or nearly 11ιι same
seholia aethe MS of Buda. Cramer assigna 11ιι St. Gallen MS.
1ο 11ιι eleventh century, and supposes 11 to have eome from 11ιι
same source as the other.

'l'he Codex Budensis is chiefly relied upon by ‘awo late editors,
otto Jahn (Berlin, 1851) and C. F. Hermann (Leipzig, 1854),
who says (Profaoe, p. 19) that 11 alone represents 11ιι genuine text
ol Juvenal, the others being derived from a 'text‘ ‘multiplici veteris
correctoris lieentia deformatum? Ι look upon this as a rash'
