xxxiv INTRODUCTION.

temporaries, the personages on whom he pours out his indignation are
those with whom he and his contemporaries were well acquainted, and
they are those of whom mention is mede by Tacitus, Suetonius, the

. younger Pliny, and Martial. In the spurious Satires, on the contrary, Ἴ

which are the work of sDeclamator, as Ribbeck calls him, the few
names which may belong to contemporaries of Juvenal are with some
exceptione totally unknown. These Satires eleo give us little informa-
tion on manners or events in Rome, while nearly every line of the
genuine Satires contains instructive matter. The Declamator abounds
in allusione to Greek aud Roman history and to mythical legende.
Even Moses is introduced to us. It is true that the writer of the
genuine Satires shows that he was well acquainted with Greek and
Roman history; but he handles his matter like 0 man 01 001100, who
known the world, while the Declamator writes like a pedant.

The Declamator, who tells ue little about Rome, tr‘eate us witha great
deal about foreign parts, and in the 1110011111 Satine he even takes us
11110 Egypt3 and yet, as Ribbeck maintains, he does 1101 even know that
Canopus (xv. 44, and the note) is in Egypt.

It has been observed 0100, he adds, 11101 the Declamator has a turn 101

philosophy, but the genuina Juvenal scarcely indicates any 10010 101 such “ ¹
speculation. He never uses 1110 word Sapientia, which the Declamator ¹

prizes highly, and, following the Stoic doctrina, declares that Nature aud
Philosophy teach the same thing (xiii. 189). He seems also to heve
collected some of his philosophical matter from 011101 1111101ος 101
instance, Sat. x. 28, 110, greatly resembles a passage in Seneca De
tranquillitate Animi, c. 15, ‘Democritum potius ;’ and the matter 01 0
passage in Sat. x. 346 may have been derived from Valerius Maximus,
vii. 2, Ext. l (see the 11010 on that passage).

From this brief statement the reader may collect the nature of the
general objections to the genuineness of the five Satires which Ribbeck
attributes 10 en unknown Declametor. He supports his general con·
alusion by an examination 01 many passages, and he employs 0 chapter
01111100-01101-001011111 well filled pages in belabouring the unfortunate
Declamator, to whom, aa far as I have observed, he allows uo merit 01
011, not even to the few lines which moy be admired by those who do

not velue all the Declamator's poetry. Those who will take the paine ¹

to read Ribbeck's satir-icel remarks on the false Setirist, will be amused
and instructed, if they shall not be convinced. In fact he has under-
taken to prove what is often difficolt to prove, and sometimes impossible;
10 show from 0 compariaon of writiugs, attributed to the same person,
11101 some are genuine and some 010 101. But he evidently 1100 conli-

dence in his own conclusion, and he presses 11 so hard 11101 he sometimes ’
misunderstands or 0110010 not to understand that which others may find ¹
