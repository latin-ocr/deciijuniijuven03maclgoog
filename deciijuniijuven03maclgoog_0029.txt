LIFE OF PERSIUS. xxv

' He reverenced as a father Servilius Nonianus. Through Cornutus be
made the acquaintance ol' Annaeus Lucanus likewiset, who was 01 his
own age aud a disciple of Cornutus. Now Cornutus was a tragie writer
01 that day', of the Stoic sect, aud he left behind him books cf philo·
sophy. Lucanus so admired the writings 01 Flaccus, that while he was
reciting he eould scarcely refrain from crying out [aud saying that this
was true poetry]'. He became acquainted with Seneca also, late in
life, but not so as to be taken by his character. He enjoyed iu Cornu·
tus’ house the society of two most learned meu of very hely lives, at
that time earnestly engaged in philosophy, namely, Claudius Agathe
merus, a physician of Lacedaemon, and Petronius Aristocrates of
Magnesia, whom above all others he admired and emulated, for they
were his contemporaries and disciples of Cornutus ⁰. He was aleo for
nearly teu years greatly beloved by Paetus Thrasea, aud travelled
with him sometimes, Thrasea having married Persius’ lrinswomau Arria.
He wasa man 01 most gentle manners, ol' maideuly modesty, of hand-
some form, aud a pattern of piety towards his mother, and sister, and
aunt. He was discreet aud chaste. He left about two million
sesterces to his mother and sister, aud only wrote a note to his mother,
asking her to give Cornutus a hundred thousand sesterces, as some say,
but as others will have it, twenty pounds’ weight cf wrought silver, and
about seven hundred volumes ol' Chrysippus, or all his library ¹. But
Cornutus toolr the books and left the money for his mother and sister,
whom he had made his heirs ¹. He wrote sellom aud slowly. This
very boolr he left unlinisbed. Some verses have been talreu from the
eud 01 the book, that it might seem finished. Cornutus made some
tridiug corrections; and when Caesius Bassus selred that he might him·
seli be allowed to edit it, he gave it him for that purpose. Flaccus also
iu his boyhood had written a comedy called Restio ⁸, and one book 01

as Cornutus himself was. ⁴

⁷ ‘Trsgicua' the reading of all the MSS„ is most probably corrupt.

¹ ‘⁶ Quin illa esse vera poemata diceret.” 'l'hese words are uo doubt an interpolation.
Heinrich thinks tbe interpolator had in mind the modest lauguage of Persius iu the

¹ 'rna should be ‘or us some say? but ibe text is defective. (Heinrich.) As 10 the
boolrs of Chrysippus, see Introduction 10 S. v.

¹ The MSS. bave ‘⁶ pecuniam sororibus quas frater heredes fecerat reliquit,” which
contradicta what has just been said. ‘Frater’ was added when the first mistslrc, ‘soror-i-
bun' was made.

² 'l'he MSS. have Vescia. Heinrich changes thieto Restio, the Ropemulrer, which
was the title 01 ons 01 Laberius' forces.
