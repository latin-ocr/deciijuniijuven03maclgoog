D. JUNII JUVENALIS

SATIRA ΙΙ.

INTRODUOTION.

Tma satire is lavelled at those persons iu the upper rauks of society (and particularly
it would soem at the Emperor Domitian) who, pretending a stoical virtue aud crying
out against vice and calling up stringent old lawa against it, were themselves practising
the worst vices in secret, and giving to the agea character which never had been equalled,
and could never be surpassed, for debsuchery cf the fllthiest kind. 'l'he Commentators
have generally sappam the Satira to be aimed at the professioual philosophare of
the day. “The poet in this Satyr inveighs against the Hypocrisie of the Philosophers
and Priests of his time,” is Tute's account of the argument. What his notions of a
Roman priest may have been it is hard te say, but he writes:

“ When hypocrites read lecturas, aud a sot,
Because iuto a Gown and Pulpit got,
'l'ho’ suricit·gorged aud taching from the Stews,
Nothing but Abstinence for's theme will chuse.”

Heinrich, iu a dissertation of much sagacity, has shown that Juvenal's meaning is very
different from this, aud the scope of the poem more wide and important. uuo vices and
hypocrisy of Domitian were' imitated by the respectable pcople, aad at these he aime his
invectivas.

From the word ‘ nuper' in a. 29, it has been inferred that the satire was written soon
after the events there referred to, which took place ΔΛ). 83. ‘Nuper' admits ι good
deal ot' latitude, as it otten does in Cicero, but it is reasonable to suppose that Juvenal

.ι wrote while the matter was pretty fresh; and as the satire clearly bas reference to tho

time of Domitian, that it was written before his reign was over. Domitian was
maassinated in September, sn. 96. It is not very likely that he gare it much
publicity while the tyraut was alive.

For indignant power there is none of the poems that excels this. 'lhe nature of tha
snbjeots however renders it alruost unreadahle, and nothing but the honesty of the
writer could make the tssk of editing it endureble. Whoever would jndge of the
differente between the spirit of true indignation and that of a wealr or impure mind in
dealing with such pdnful subjecta, should compare J urensl with his translator lhte,
who hes taken from the satire the best recommendation it hus, which is the virtue of
the author. Ifthe psalm-translator and poet-laureata was a man oi purity, he hssdone
himself injustica. 'l'he other translatore have executed their tnsk better in this respect.

ARGUMENT.

1 would gladly run to the utmost North when canting hypocritas dare talk of ¹morula,
mere ignorant fellows, though they fill their shelves with buats. No faith is iu their
outside. 'The whole town is teemiug with these solemn villaius. What, you reprove
eloethe foulest of all foul pretenders! ‘lhey effect few words, aud silence, und
cropped hair ς more honest furis Peribomius,who makes nosceret of his sin. 1 leave
him to hisdestinyy 1 pity him. But they are worst who with lina words attach such
vices. ‘⁴ l am no worse than you,” says Varillus the degraded. Lat the straight-
limbed lnugh attha bandy-legged, the fair at theblsckaruoor. For who would tolerate
the Gracchi complaining of sedition, nor exclaim il Verres should effect to hate a thies,
Milo a murderer, Clodius an adulterer, Catilina Cethegus, or Sulla's pupils carp at
his proscriptioni But such was he who, while his fatal incest was in the doing, and
while hia uiecewssspawuing her abortione, restored the bitterest laws a'gainm adultery.
