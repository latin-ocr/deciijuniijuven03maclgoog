Όδοιπορικά ⁴, and a few verses for the wife of Thrasea, on her mother
Arria, who had killed herself before her husband ⁸. All these Cornutus
advised his mother ιο destroy. When his book was published, man
began forthwith ιο admira and ιο seiza upon it ⁸. [He diedesa discase
of the stomach in the thirtieth year of hia age ¹. But· afterwards, when
he had left his school and toscham, having read the tenth hook of
Lucilius, he eonceired a great desire to write Satires. The beginning
of that book he imitated ⁸, first intending te abuse himself ¹, and aster-

remained under the care of his mother Fulvia Sisennia at his native
place, where he went to school till he was twelre years old ¹. Like

brated teochers of the day, Remmius Palaemon ², the other of Virginius
Flavus, arhetorician of eminenee, who was afterwards exiled by Nero ⁴.
He took the ‘toga vhilis ' at sixteen, the usual age, and according ιο

his twenty-eighth year. 'l'his clause is not from the original, but added hythe com·
