SATIRA XII.

Vestibus extentis et, quod mperaverat unum,

Velo prora suo. Jam deficientibus Austris

Spes vitae cum eole redit : tum gratus Iulo, 70
Atque novercali sedes praelata Lavino,

Conspicitur sublimia apex, cui eandida nomen

Scrofa dedit, laetis Phrygibus mirabile eumen,

Et nunquam visis triginta clera mamillis.

Tandem intrat poeitae inclusa per aequora moles 7⁵
Tyrrhenamque Pharon porrectaque brachia rursum,

Quae pelago occurrunt medio longeque relinquunt
Italiam—non sic igitur mirabere portus

Qnoe natura dedit-aed trunca puppe magister

Interiora petit Baianae pervia cymbae

Tuti stagna sinus, gaudent ubi vertice raso

Garrula securi narrare pericula nautae.
