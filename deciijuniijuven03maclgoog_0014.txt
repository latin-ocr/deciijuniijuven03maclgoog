tion, showing that they were both oopied from a MS. written in
the year nn. 402, by one Fl. Julius. The later of these, whiehis
ut Rome, Heinrich oollated. The collationes the earlier used by
Jahn is by Duebner. Their taslr was rendered more laborious hy

the strange orthography of the MSS. and their many palpable
blunders. A more aeeurate and useful MS. is one of the tenth
eentury (whioh is not however eomplete), in the library of Bern.
There are several of the tenth and eleventh centurias, and it is olear
that Persius, though he must have been but little understood ', was a
good deal read among the semipagani of the mediaeval monasteries.

The Satires of Persius are here joined with those of Juvenal,

aoeording to a common praetioe. But exeept for the convenienee of ¹

publication, there is no reason why they should be so. United they
form a fair-sized volume, whioh separately they would not do
except by extending the notes on either to an inordinate and useless
length. Persius, though older than Juvenal, yet, as being less read
und of less importanoe, is usually and rightly put aster him.

It is easy to write long notas on suoh authors as these 3 indeed
the difficulty is to write atmoderate length3 even without the prao-
tiee, whieh 1 think objeotiunable‚ of overlaying the text with an
embarrassing heap of referenoes. Among other ways of lengthening
this commentary was one which to some general readers would have
been aoeeptable. I might have dwolt upon the immorality of the
age, and contrasted the praetiee of the heathen with the oontem-
porary preoepts of the Christian. But I do not think any observa-
' tions of mine would have strengthened the lauguage of Juvenal,
and if I have helped Christiam to read and understand him, I shall
be satisfied. They will beable then to compare the profligaey of
the degenerate Roman with the purity of the Christian's profession,
and perhaps may find in the rebukes of the Satirist matter for more
useiul contemplation than that whioh dwells upon the viees and
superstitious of former ages, and overlooks the viees and super·
stitione of our own.
