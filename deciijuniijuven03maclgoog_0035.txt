LIPE OT PERSIUS. xxxi

a lew passages, the Satires are us free hom difficulty ss most ol
Juvenal’s‘.

They were much admired by the sustentat sud have been abun·
dandy quoted by Gmmmariaus, by Futhers of the Church‚ eud
mediasval writers. If certain passages are less familiar ιο modern
ears than their fitness for quotation might lead us to expect, it is from
the difficulties of the poesy, which heve deterred men of our day from
reading itas it deserves. The subject of the first Satire, which desis
with the viciens poeticul teste of the day, and has muny quotutions hem,
or imitatione of, the verses of contemporary writers, would be more in-
terestiug and intelligible when it was first published than it is to us,
aud this Saum alone would creste a lsrge demand lor the volume. The
Epistle to Macrinus comcs more home to ourselves ss dealing with the
worship ol God‚ the selfish or worldly ahuseol which ia common to all
ages· The introduction I have prefixed to the third Satira msy per·
heps lead some to read it with curiosity, and they will not be disap-
pointed. The more I read it, themora I admire it. Seli-ignorunce is
a large subject, which might be better handled than it is in the fourth

susim and the l'olly of running after end hoerding money ιο be squan-
dered by one’s heirs is not done us much justice to in the sixth se it
probably would have been is the poet had finished it. The fitth is

generally considered the best in the book, though I myself prefer the
third In the lilth there is thet tribute to the goodness ol' Cornutus
which proves tha goodness of the writer and the grscefulness with which
he could write. It nlso shows more ol the philosophicsl school in
which Persius had been ednod, without however introducing any thing
more new than the Steic doctrine thet the only hee men is the
suge, with which Cicero and Herses had before made their readers
familiar. There are more imitatione ol Horace in this Satire than in
other.
⁸115A writer ol satire may be ‘serus et violens’ with his pen, and yet
very amisble iu manners, us the Grammarian describes Persius to have
been. He mey nlsc in those dsys heve been chaste und modest, and yet
have used laugusge for the exposure ol vice which now cannot be used,
er even reud without disccml'ort. There is nothing in Persius’ style to
contradict the pleasing description given ol him by his biographer, which
probably was quite trus. More than one gem now in existence has

⁴ Jnl. Scaliger thought Persius wrote obscurely on purpose that loeis might sdrrdrs
him. He is very severe on Persius. (See Scul. Poet. vi. c. 6, itte. 97.)
⁸ Quintilian (x. 1. 94) says, ‘⁶ Multum et verus glorius, quamvis nno libro, Persius
nemis? Mmtu'al (ir. 29) says,
“ Ssepius in libro numeretur Persius uno
Quum levis in totu Marsus Amazonidc.''
