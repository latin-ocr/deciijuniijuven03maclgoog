272 . D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Pergula, discipulus Trypheri doctoris, apud quem

Sumine cum magno lepus atque aper et pygargus
Et Scythicae volucres et phoenicopterus ingens

Et Gaetulus oryx hebeti lautissima ferro 140
Caeditur, et tota sonat ulmea coena Suburra.

Nec frustum capreae subducere nec latus Afrae

Novit avis noster, tirunculus ac rudis omni

Tempore et exiguae furtis imbutus ofellae.

Plebeios calices et paucis assibus emptos

Porriget incultus puer atque a frigore tutus,

Non Phryx aut Lycius, non a mangone petitus
Quisquam erit ct magno. Quum posces, posce Latine.
