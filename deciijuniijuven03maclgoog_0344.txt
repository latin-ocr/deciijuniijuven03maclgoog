296 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Nos hominum divumque fidem clamore ciamus,

Quanto Faesidium laudat vocalis agentem

Quem tua simplicitas risum vulgo moveat, quum 35
Exigis a quoquam ne pejeret, et putet ullis

Esse aliquod numen templis araeque rubenti?

Sumeret agrestem posito diademate falcem

Saturnus fugiens, tunc quum virguncula Juno 40
Et privatus adhue Idaeis J uppiter antris,
