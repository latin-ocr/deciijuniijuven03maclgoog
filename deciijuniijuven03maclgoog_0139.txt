SATIRA V.

IN'l'RODUC'l'ION.

llus satire professes ιο be addresscd ιο one metius. the representative ci a class οι
nen, vrbo being poor and exquisitely servile, were willing ιο part with their indepen-
deuce and put up with all sorta οι contemptnous treatment for the sake οι a dinuer ιι
the tables οι the rich. A specimen οι euch a dinner is given, at which Virro the host
resones lor himscli¹ and his rich tiiends the best οι every thing, meat and fruit end
vine, and the parasites ere sulkily served with the worst, by slaves too flue to make up
tolbeguests ior the master's neglect. J uvennl’s conclusion is,tbat they who will put
up vitb euch treatment deservo it t sud the rich men ιι ιιοι much ιο ιιιιιιο ιι he
despises those who are only (ιιιιιιι ιο liis table hythe nese, that is, by the sevour οι
his litcben.

Thesauro basiis moral ιοι· medem secietyss m which, ιι the relation οι host aud
guest ιι presented hy good breeding ιιοιιι taking the form here represented, eating and
savility are scarcely less prominent leetmes then they were at Ronm ιιι ιιι worst
days Ιι the rich look devm upon the poor, ιι“ ιι usually because of the homage rank
and ricbee meet with; aud that this homage comes ef selflshneee none lanow better
then those who receive ιι. The coveting οι what is called good society ιι the vice of a
rottei systemg and theman who scelus company which does ιιοι want him hes no
ιιιιοιι tacomplain ιι his pride is galled and his expectatione ere disappointed. If there
were no Trebinses ιιι the world there would be no Virres: so Juvenal thought ς end he
does well to lay the chief weight ol his satire upon the parasite.

l'he parasite, cr dium-out, οι later times had no resemblance ιο the client οι the
republic lle was ιιο more than one οι many in the train οι a rich man, or οι ιι many
rich meu ss he could get attached ιο ιιι that mean capacity. The old relation οι
‘petronaci and ‘cliens' so far ue we ono understand it, was simple and natural. 'l'he
ather wan the mere refuge οι poverty, preferring the bread οι idlenese aud a false
langueton life οι honest labeur and the rewerds οι au independeut mind. The
ltudent vill only be misled ιι, following some οι the commentatore, he looks upon the
latter condition ss only another phase οι the former. 'l'he old institution died ont with
therepublic ιι belonged to; tho medem practice was the fraitoi human corruption,
sud has its malogies iu all ages οι society, euch as ie called civilized.
