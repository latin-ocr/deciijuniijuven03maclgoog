e tyr-ent who mocked its wenhness und plcyed with its servility‚ is
emusingly shown in the fourth Sotiis. The fifth expoees u different

accept contempt for the sulse of e mccl grudgingly given e low practice
which was more systematized ot Rome, if it wes not much more common,
then itis in our own country. The neglect of litemry meu hes u Setire
to itsell' (the seventh); nristocrctic pride hes another (the eighth). The
cunning of will-hunters is hit oll' et the end of the twetlth, which is not
among the most interesting of these compositione. It reletes chiefly ιο·
the crrivul of e friend efter u dungeroue voysge, cnd is more of the
nature of s fsmffiur letter theu of e Sotlre. The dishouesty of the ege
is described in the thirtcenth Sctire, which contains some of duvensl’s
