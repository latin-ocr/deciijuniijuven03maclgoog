xxxii INTRODUCTION.

been supposed to represent the handsome features attributed to Persius,
hut they may he any body, und we must be content with the Gram-
mariau’s testimony to his beauty.

Trrn publishers of this edition of Juvenal and Persius, having deter-

mined to reprint the book, asked me to correct the sheets. Though very

busy about other things, I could not refuee to perform this slight service

for the work of my deperted friend. Itis to me a cause of great regret

that ΜΓ. Maeleane did not live to revise this volume. His testes aud

his ahilities particularly qualified him to bo an editor of Juvenal and

Persius; and us a first edition of such a book must be imperfect, he

would certainly have improved it, if he had lived long enough. His

knowledge of the world, his strong sense, quiek perception, and sound

judgment, applied to s second edition, might have produced a work thet

would have satisfied the readers of Juvenal und Persius for some time.

What hohas done however· is well worth preserving, und I believe thet

future editors,-and in due time they will appeten—may find in the Intro-

ductions, Argumenta, and Notos, much matter that will help theru towards

the meaning of the Satirists. Ido not think that Mr. Maoleans has

' often missed the sense of his authors, and he has certainly seized

it sometimes where other editors have not. He possessed oue qualityin

a striking degree-a hold and independent judgment, without which an

editor is in danger of being confused and misled by a great variety of

opinions. His notes show the character of his mind. He osten ex-

presses his opinion very positively‚ aud sometimes perhaps in away that

may offend; but he had a sincere respect for good sense and souud

knowledge in others; he had none of the feehle eoueeit which often goes

with what is termed learning, and he had some reason to feel ooufidence 7

in his own judgment, for few men were so quiek in detecting an ἵ

absurdity or went so straight to the meaning of a thing. The intro· l

duction to the thirteenth Satira of Juvenal is an evidence of his large l

and liberal views ou a subject on which many who belong to his profes· g

sion, anderen others who donet, have uttered end ‚still utter their l
wretched commonplaces. '

I have not altered the text of this edition, and iu only a few

places the punctuation. Ihave added a collation of this text of

Juvenal with that of Jahn, whose useful edition is now generally
