D. J UNII JUVENALIS

Ipse capillato diffusum Consule potat
calcatamque tenet bellis socialibus uvam,

qudjqqq nunquam cyathum missurus amieo.
Cras bibet Albanis aliquid de montibus aut de
Setinis, cujus patriam titulumque senectus
Delevit multa veteris fuligine testae3

Quale coronati Thrasea Helvidiusque bibebant

Brutorum et Caesi natalibus. Ipse capaces ·

Heliadum Q et inaequales beryllo

Virro tenet phialas: tibi non committitur anrum;

Vel, si quando datur, eustos affinis ibidem ιο
