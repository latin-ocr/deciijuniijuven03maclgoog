great crowds, and with great success, several times: so that he was led
to insert in his first writings those verses which he had written first:
‘Quod nou dant proceres dabit histrio: tn &marinos

hc Bareas, tu nobilium magna atria emas?
Praefectos Pelopea facit, Philomela tribunes ζ’

The player was at that time one of the favourites at court, aad many of
his supportem were daily promoted. Juvenal, therefore, fell under.
suspicion as one who had covertly censured the times ς and sorthwith
under colour of military promotior, though he was eighty years of ege,
hewse removed from the city, and sent to be praefectus of a eohort
which was stationed in the farthest pert of Egypt. That sort of
punishment was determined upon as being suited ιο a light and jocular
offense. Within a very short time he died of vexation and disgust.'’

The chief points stated in the foregoing life are, that Juvenal was the
son of a rich freedman either by birth or by adoption (for this I suppose
the writer means); that he was e praetised rhetorieian3 that he began
to write satire efter middle lise3 that his first attempt was aa epigram
upon Paris the pantomimus·¹ ; that be was encouraged by the success of .
this productiora to write Satires on a larger scale, which at first he
concealed but afterwards read them ιο large audientes with great
appianae ς that whereas he was raah enough to introduce in one of his
poema the original epigram (which, aa I suppose the writer means ιο
impiy, so beans more publio, and probably for the first time reached
the ears of the person it was aimed at), Paris by his influence at
court obtained his banishment, under the honourahle feam of a military
command, ιο the farthest part of Egypt 2 that he was then eighty years
of age ⁴, and that he shortly died of vexation. .

Another of these notioes states that Juvenal was born at Aquinum,
in the reign of Claudiuss that he retmned from exile, survivsd the
reign of Trajan, and hrmlly died of old age in a ut of coughiag.

Ine third waere told that when he mhmned to Rome, finding his* '
friend Martial was dead he died of grief in his eighty-second year.

A fourth says it was Domitian who exiled him; that he never re5
turned, but that aster oorrecting and adding to his Satires in Egypt, he
died there of old age in the reign of Antoninos Pius.

icm a fifth we learnt that he was advanoed to the eqnestsian rank
-throngh his own merit ς· that the place of his honounable exile was
&omna and that tho notive was tint he might be killed in bauls3
