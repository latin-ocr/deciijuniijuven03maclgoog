SATIRA VI.

Sum tibi Mercurius 3 venio Deus huc ego, ut ille

Pingitur: an renuis? vis tu gaudere relictis?

Deest aliquid summae, minui mihi: sed tibi totum est

Quicquid id est. Ubi sit iuge quaerere quod mibi quondam

Legerat Tadius, neu dicta repone paterna: 66

‘Poenoris accedat merces ,· hine exime sumptus!

“ Quid reliquum est ?” Reliquum i-Nune, nune impensius

Unge‚ puer, caules. Mihi festa luce coquatur
Urtica et fissa fumosum sinciput aure,

Ut tuus iste nepos olim satur anseris extis,
Cum morosa vago singultiet inguine vena, -
Patriciae immeiat vulvae? mihi trama figurae
